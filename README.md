# Glasgow Treasures Website

The purpose of the project is to allow people that are currently in Glasgow or people who are looking to visit to be able to find attractions and 
things to do when they in the area. It is designed in a way that they can interact with the website and leave comments and recomendations for other 
people to try when they are visiting Glasgow. We have also gave a few of what we think the best places in Glasgow are to visit to help people get 
started when organising their days.

The thing that makes the website different from others is the way that users go about finding locations. For example there is not a tab or link that 
will show all of the bars in the area although this can be done using the search bar in the Google Maps API. Users have to find places either using 
the search bar, following our recommendations or trusting others that have visited the site and left their own recommendation.

## UX 

The project is essentially a single page application that allows users to search and find things to do when visiting the city of Glasgow.# milestone-2
